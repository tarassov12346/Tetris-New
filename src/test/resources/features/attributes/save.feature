Feature: Save Game
  I want to check the functionality of Save button and Restart button

  Background:
    Given I open the game page thru "firefox"
    And  player waits 3 seconds
    And player presses 3 times Left button and Drop button and player waits 3 seconds
    And player presses 2 times Right button and Drop button and player waits 3 seconds
    And player presses Drop button and player waits 3 seconds
    And player presses Save button
    And player again opens the game page and player waits 3 seconds
    And player again presses 2 times Right button and Drop button and player waits 3 seconds
    And player again presses Drop button and player waits 3 seconds

  Scenario: Having pressed the Save button after playing the game for some time the game is restarted by pressing Restart button

    When player presses Restart button
    Then mosaic of fallen tetraminos changes into that as it was when Save button was pressed during previous game
    And the restarted game have the same player name as the saved one
    And the restarted game have the same player score as the saved one
